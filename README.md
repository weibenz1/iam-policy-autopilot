# IAM Policy Autopilot

An open source Model Context Protocol (MCP) server and command-line tool that helps your AI coding assistants quickly create baseline IAM policies that you can refine as your application evolves, so you can build faster. IAM Policy Autopilot analyzes your application code locally to generate identity-based policies for application roles, enabling faster IAM policy creation and reducing access troubleshooting time. IAM Policy Autopilot supports applications built in Python, Go, and TypeScript.

## Who is IAM Policy Autopilot for?

IAM Policy Autopilot is for builders on AWS using AI coding assistants, including developers, product managers, technical experimenters, and business leaders.

## How is IAM Policy Autopilot helpful?

IAM Policy Autopilot is:

### Fast

IAM Policy Autopilot accelerates development by generating baseline identity-based IAM policies. Your AI coding assistant can call IAM Policy Autopilot to analyze AWS SDK calls within your application. IAM Policy Autopilot then automatically creates the baseline IAM permissions for your application roles.

### Reliable

IAM Policy Autopilot's deterministic code analysis helps create reliable and valid IAM policies that reduce policy troubleshooting. By using valid policies created with the MCP server, you reduce time spent on policy-related debugging and accelerate application deployment by avoiding permission-related delays.

### Up-to-date

IAM Policy Autopilot stays up to date with the latest AWS services and features so that builders and coding assistants have access to the latest AWS IAM permissions knowledge. It helps keep your application role's permissions current with AWS's evolving capabilities.

## Best Practices and Considerations

### Review and refine policies generated by IAM Policy Autopilot

IAM Policy Autopilot generates policies to provide a starting point that you can refine as your application matures. Review the generated policies so that they align with your security requirements before deploying them.

### Understand the IAM Policy Autopilot scope

IAM Policy Autopilot produces IAM identity-based policies, but doesn't support resource-based policies such as S3 bucket policies or KMS key policies, Resource Control Policies (RCPs), Service Control Policies (SCPs), and permission boundaries. These are the limitations that you need to keep in mind. For example, if your code calls `s3.getObject(bucketName)` where `bucketName` is determined at runtime, IAM Policy Autopilot currently doesn't predict which bucket will be accessed.

### Understand the boundary between IAM Policy Autopilot and your coding assistant

IAM Policy Autopilot generates policies with specific actions based on deterministic analysis of your code. When you use the MCP server integration, your AI coding assistant receives this policy and might modify it when creating infrastructure-as-code templates. For example, you might see the assistant add specific resource Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) or include KMS key IDs based on additional context from your code. These changes come from your coding assistant's interpretation of your broader code context, not from the static analysis provided by IAM Policy Autopilot. Always review content generated by your coding assistant before deployment to verify that it meets your security requirements.

## Getting Started

### Installation

#### Option 1: Using uv (Recommended)

Install [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/) from Astral.

No additional installation needed - you can run IAM Policy Autopilot directly using `uvx iam-policy-autopilot`.

#### Option 2: Using pip

Install [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/).

```bash
pip install iam-policy-autopilot
```

#### Option 3: Direct installation (MacOS/Linux only)

To install the latest release directly, run the following script to download and install as a system utility.

```bash
curl -sS https://github.com/awslabs/iam-policy-autopilot/raw/refs/heads/main/install.sh | sudo sh
```

This will install the latest release directly to `/usr/local/bin/iam-policy-autopilot`.

### AWS Configuration

IAM Policy Autopilot requires AWS credentials to apply policy fixes and upload policies for AccessDenied debugging.

Install [AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html) and configure your AWS credentials.

For more information on AWS credential configuration, see the [AWS CLI Configuration Guide](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html).

### MCP Server Configuration

Configure the MCP server in your MCP client configuration to enable your AI coding assistant to generate IAM policies.

#### For Kiro

Get Kiro from [https://kiro.dev/](https://kiro.dev/)

**If using uv/uvx:**

Add the following configuration to your project-level `.kiro/settings/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam-policy-autopilot": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iam-policy-autopilot", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

**If using pip:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam-policy-autopilot": {
      "command": "iam-policy-autopilot",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      },
      "disabled": false,
      "autoApprove": []
    }
  }
}
```

#### For Kiro CLI

Get Kiro CLI from [https://kiro.dev/cli](https://kiro.dev/cli)

Kiro Cli uses the same configuration as Kiro mentioned above, additionally, MCPs for Kiro CLI can also be setup via:

**If using uv/uvx:**

```
kiro-cli mcp add \
  --name iam-policy-autopilot \
  --command "uvx" \
  --args "iam-policy-autopilot","mcp-server"
```

**If using pip:**

```
kiro-cli mcp add \
  --name iam-policy-autopilot \
  --command "iam-policy-autopilot" \
  --args "mcp-server"
```

#### For Claude Desktop

Add to your Claude Desktop configuration file:

**macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**Windows**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Linux**: `~/.config/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`

**If using uv/uvx:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam-policy-autopilot": {
      "command": "uvx",
      "args": ["iam-policy-autopilot", "mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**If using pip:**

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "iam-policy-autopilot": {
      "command": "iam-policy-autopilot",
      "args": ["mcp-server"],
      "env": {
        "AWS_PROFILE": "your-profile-name",
        "AWS_REGION": "us-east-1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
