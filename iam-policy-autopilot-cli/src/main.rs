//! IAM Policy Autopilot CLI
//!
//! This is the main entry point for the iam-policy-autopilot command-line tool.
//!
//! # Exit Codes
//!
//! The CLI uses the `ExitCode` enum which maps to the following exit codes:
//!
//! - `ExitCode::Success` (0): Operation completed successfully
//! - `ExitCode::Duplicate` (1): Duplicate statement - permission already exists
//! - `ExitCode::Error` (2): User refused, validation failed, non-interactive environment,
//!   or manual action required
//!
//! These exit codes are used consistently throughout the CLI to allow shell scripts
//! and automation tools to distinguish between different failure modes.
//!
//! See `types::ExitCode` for the enum definition.
